# This file contain the mappings between the source and destination spaces.
#
# Each line represents a mapping between the id of the space on the source Looker Instance and the id of the space on
# the destination Looker Instance.  Typically, the source space id is the personal space id on the looker instance
# where we want to migrate its content.  The destination space id is the corresponding space id of the Looker instance
# where we want to migrate to.
#
# Example:
#
# 15,68
#
# The line above indicates that we will migrate everything inside space id 15 from the src Looker instance to the
# space id of 68 on the destination Looker.
#
# Note: LookerMT will check to make sure that the src and dst spaces exist on the src and dst Looker instance
# correspondingly.  If either does not exist, LookerMT will exit.
#
